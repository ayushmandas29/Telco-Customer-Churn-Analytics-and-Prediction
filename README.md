## 🧠 Project Overview

Telecom companies lose money when customers **churn** (leave the service).  
This project simulates a real telecom scenario:

- Cleans and processes telco customer data  
- Analyzes patterns related to churn (tenure, contract, charges, etc.)  
- Trains a Machine Learning model to predict if a customer will churn  
- Exposes insights and predictions through a **web dashboard** built in Streamlit  

This is designed as a **portfolio / industry-style project**, not just a basic assignment.
